## Test Infrastructure

### Setup Files
- `vitest.config.ts` - Vitest configuration with React plugin and JSDOM environment
- `src/test/setup.ts` - Global test setup with mocks for external dependencies
- `src/test/utils.tsx` - Common test utilities and custom render function

### Mocking Strategy
- **Store mocking**: All Zustand store interactions are properly mocked
- **Router mocking**: React Router components are mocked for testing
- **Icon mocking**: Heroicons are mocked with test IDs for easy selection
- **External dependencies**: All external libraries are mocked appropriately

### Test Dependencies Added
- `vitest` - Test runner
- `@testing-library/react` - React testing utilities
- `@testing-library/user-event` - User interaction simulation
- `@testing-library/jest-dom` - Custom matchers
- `jsdom` - DOM environment for testing
- `@vitest/ui` - UI for test runner

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:ui

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## Test Quality Features

### Comprehensive Coverage
- **Rendering tests**: Verify components render correctly
- **Interaction tests**: Test user interactions (clicks, typing, etc.)
- **State management tests**: Test component state changes
- **Props tests**: Test different prop combinations
- **Edge case tests**: Test error conditions and edge cases
- **Styling tests**: Verify correct CSS classes are applied
- **Accessibility tests**: Ensure proper ARIA attributes and semantic structure

### Best Practices
1. **Isolation**: Each test is independent and doesn't rely on other tests
2. **Descriptive names**: Test names clearly describe what is being tested
3. **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Tests follow the AAA pattern
4. **User-centric**: Tests focus on user behavior rather than implementation details
5. **Accessibility**: Tests verify proper accessibility attributes and structure

### Error Handling
- Tests handle edge cases like undefined data
- Tests verify proper error states
- Tests check for proper fallback behavior
